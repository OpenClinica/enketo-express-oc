# Enketo Express fork for OpenClinica

_The [Enketo Smart Paper](https://enketo.org) web application._ It can be used directly by form servers or used as inspiration for building applications that wrap [Enketo Core](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core). See [this diagram](https://enketo.org/develop/) for a summary of how the different Enketo components are related.

---

This is a fork of [enketo/enketo-express](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-express) that has the following additions:

1. An [account manager](https://swaggerhub.com/api/Enketo/enketo-express-oc-account-manager) to use multiple accounts with a single Enketo installation.
2. A [fieldsubmission](./doc/fieldsubmission.md) webform view that uses [OpenClinica's Fieldsubmission API](https://swaggerhub.com/api/martijnr/openclinica-fieldsubmission).
3. An OpenClinica theme: [theme-oc](https://github.com/OpenClinica/enketo-express-oc/tree/master/app/views/styles/theme-oc).
4. [Advanced comment widgets](./doc/advanced-comment-widgets.md): [discrepancy note widget](./doc/advanced-comment-widgets.md#discrepancy-notes-widget)

**To get started visit our [technical documentation](https://enketo.github.io/enketo-express).**

---

OpenClinica users, in addition to the configuration documentation linked above, may want to take special note of these recommended settings:

0. Set a secret value for `"account manager api key"` (or set it to `false` if OC's custom Account Manager is not used).
1. The `"linked form and data server"` object should not have `"server url"` and `"api key"` properties (if OC's custom Account Manager API is used).
2. Set `"disable save as draft": true`
3. Set `"repeat ordinals": true`. [This feature](./doc/ordinals.md) is required for the fieldsubmission webform views.
4. Set `"query parameter to pass to submission": "ecid"`
5. Set `"validate continuously": true`
6. Set `"validate page": false` (though some applications may wish to use `true`)
7. Set `"default theme": "oc"`
8. Set `"text field character limit": 3999`

OpenClinica users, to build special Internet Explorer 11 javascript bundles, do after the regular build (ie. `npm install`):

0. `grunt build-ie11`

### Project status

Enketo was initiated in 2009 by Martijn van de Rijdt as a web-based alternative or complement to [ODK Collect](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro/). It has become a core component of the ODK ecosystem and been adopted by several organizations beyond that ecosystem.

As of 2022, Enketo is maintained by [Trevor Schmidt](https://github.com/eyelidlessness/) and [the ODK team](https://getodk.org/about/team.html). Martijn continues to provide advice and continuity. The ODK project sets priorities in collaboration with its [Technical Advisory Board](https://getodk.org/about/ecosystem.html).

Our current primary goals are:

-   Increasing alignment with ODK Collect, particularly in service of submission edits.
-   Improving error messages so that users can get out of bad states.
-   Improving long-term maintainability by modernizing code bases, removing code duplication, and simplifying state mutation.

Feature requests and project discussion are welcome on the [ODK forum](https://forum.getodk.org/).
